So I've started a blog. It will be focused around **machine learning** to begin with but will in the future include anything that's related to **coding**. Keywords such as Deep Neural Networks DNN, Convolutional Neural Networks CNN and Regions with Convolutional neural Networks R-CNN will most likely appear in the initial posts. I also hope to introduce some papers from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org), an online database with scientific research papers.

## More Machine Learning?
Yes, there are in fact many tutorials and posts out there on the Internet about machine learning. The aim of this blog however is to act as an complement to that data. For instance, we try to focus on areas that others usually skip, such as describing the convolution with mathematical examples in the context of CNN or visualizing networks in an unconventional matter to make you remember the internal structure of the networks more efficiently.

Much talking but let's see how it goes (talking solely to myself).
