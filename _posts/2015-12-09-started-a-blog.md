So I've started a blog. It will be focused around **machine learning**. Keywords such as Deep Neural Networks DNN, Convolutional Neural Networks CNN and Regions with Convolutional neural Networks R-CNN will appear in the beginning. I also hope to introduce some papers fetched from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) or any other database too.

## Why Another Blog About Machine Learning?
There are many tutorials and posts out there on the Internet about machine learning. The aim of this blog is to act as an complement for that information, such as explaining the parts that are usually skipped.
