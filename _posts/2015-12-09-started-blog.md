## Hi,
So I've started a blog. It will be focused around **machine learning**. Keywords such as Deep Neural Networks DNN, Convolutional Neural Networks CNN and Regional Neural Networks RCNN will appear in the beginning.

## Why another blog about machine learning?
There are many tutorials and posts out there on the Internet about machine learning. The aim of this blog is to complement the information that is already available, or explain them in a more easily understood manner. If possible, I would like to present some papers here as well.
