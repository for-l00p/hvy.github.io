## Neural Network Terminology
In the scientific field of machine learning and neural networks, method are introduced with fancy names and abbreviations all the times (at the time of writing this blog) and there is a terminology that you need to get familiar with in order to understand the papers and the articles posted on the Internet. Reading papers from [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) and [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun) will make you familiar with some of them. In papers, references can be followed to understand these concepts.

However, they are not always presented in articles. I have created a repository on GitHub that tries to list some of the most commonly occurring terms with short explanations along. There are also useful links and references to papers explaining some of the commonly reoccurring methods.
