This is a blog explaining some topics in the field of **machine learning** and maybe in programming.

I am not sure how much time I can dedicate to this blog due the the actual research that needs to be carried out but please feel free to come back a little now and then!

For more info, please visit my [homepage](http://www.hiroyukivincentyamazaki.com) or send me a [mail](mailto:hiroyuki.vincent.yamazaki@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
